    A script was created to analyze stock market trends from years 2014, 2015, and 2016. The script was able to loop through all stocks and provide a summary table with the following information: a ticker symbol, the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume of a given stock. Percent change was noted as positive or negative change by color. Also noted was greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume.
